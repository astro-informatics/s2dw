<H1 ALIGN=center> S2LITE package documentation </H1>

<H2 ALIGN=center>Jason McEwen</H2>

<P>
The S2LITE library contains functionality to support functions defined
on the sky and was developed primarily for astrophysical applications.
More generally, however, any arbitrary function defined on the sphere
may be represented.  Both real space map and harmonic space spherical
harmonic representations are supported.  Functionality is incorporated
also to represent power spectra and to convolve with beams.

<P>
The library design is based on object-oriented principles and is
implemented in Fortran 90.  Generally one must instantiate a class
object using the corresponding init routines.  The instatiated object
should be freed once it is no longer required with the corresponding
free routine (this deallocates all memory associated with the object).

<p>
A <a href=http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/>HEALPix</a> spherical
pixelisation scheme is adopted, although this may be extended in the
future to support other spherical pixelisations.  The spherical
harmonic transforms applied are all based on the routines provided by
<a href=http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/>HEALPix</a>.

<p>
For further details and installation instructions see the
<a href="../README.txt">README.txt</a>
and
<a href="../INSTALL.txt">INSTALL.txt</a>
files also.

<H2> Classes </H2>

An overview of the classes that comprise the S2LITE library is given
here.  Please click on the link for each class for detailed
documentation. 

<p>
<CODE><a href=s2_sky_mod.html>s2_sky_mod</a></CODE>: 
Provides functionality to support and manipulate a function defined
on the sky(/sphere). Support is provided to representing the sky in
both real (map) space and in harmonic (alm) space, and also to convert
between the two representations. One may also scale, dilate, rotate,
downsample and add functions defined on the sky. The sky pixelisation
used is currently based on HEALPix. 

<p>
<CODE><a href=s2_dl_mod.html>s2_dl_mod</a></CODE>: 
Functionality to compute specified plane of the Wigner dl matrix used to
perform rotations in harmonic space. (Provided by D. J. Mortlock)

<p>
<CODE><a href=s2_pl_mod.html>s2_pl_mod</a></CODE>: 
 Provides functionality to support and manipulate a pl power spectrum.

<p>
<CODE><a href=s2_vect_mod.html>s2_vect_mod</a></CODE>: 
 Provide functionality to support and rotate vectors in R^3,
 represented in either cartesian or spherical coordinates.

<p>
<CODE><a href=s2_types_mod.html>s2_types_mod</a></CODE>: 
 Definition of intrinsic types and constants used in the sph library.

<p>
<CODE><a href=s2_error_mod.html>s2_error_mod</a></CODE>: 
 Functionality to handle errors that may occur in the sph
 library. Public S2LITE error codes are defined, with corresponding
 private error comments and default halt execution status. 


<HR>
<H2> Programs </H2>

Utility programs based on the S2LITE library are listed here.  More S2LITE 
programs may appear here in the future as their need becomes
apparent.  Please click on the link for each program for detailed
documentation. 

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2_map2sky.html>s2_map2sky</a></CODE>: 
 Read a HEALPix map fits file and write the read map to a full s2_sky
 fits file. 

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2_sky2map.html>s2_sky2map</a></CODE>: 
 Read a full s2_sky file and write the map to a HEALPix fits file. 

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2_skyadd.html>s2_skyadd</a></CODE>: 
 Add or subtract two maps of the sky.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2_skydown.html>s2_skydown</a></CODE>: 
 Downsample a sky.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2_skymask.html>s2_skymask</a></CODE>: 
 Apply a mask (containing only ones and zeros) to a sky. The output
 map is the product of the mask and sky maps. If the display status is
 set then masked pixels of the output map are overwritten with a magic
 number that appears grey when plotted. Output maps producted with the
 display option set should only be used for display purposes, and not
 for any subsequent analysis.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2_skymultiply.html>s2_skymultiply</a></CODE>: 
 Multiply sky by constant scale.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2_skyprod.html>s2_skyprod</a></CODE>: 
 Take the product of two maps of the sky.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2_skyup.html>s2_skyup</a></CODE>: 
 Up-sample a sky.

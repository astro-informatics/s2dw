<H1 ALIGN=center> S2DW code documentation </H1>
<H3 ALIGN=center> By Jason McEwen and Yves Wiaux </H3>

<p>
The S2DW code provides functionality to perform the scale discretised
wavelet transform on the sphere developed in our paper:
<i>Exact reconstruction with directional
wavelets on the sphere</i> (<a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3519">ArXiv</a>|<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13448.x">DOI</a>).  Routines are provided to compute wavelet
and scaling coefficients from the spherical harmonic coefficients of a
signal on the sphere and to synthesise the spherical harmonic
coefficients of the original signal from its wavelet and scaling
coefficients.  The reconstruction of the spherical harmonic
coefficients of the original signal is exact to numerical precision.
Typically, maximum reconstruction errors are of the order 10^(-12) or
smaller.  Please see our paper for further details of the wavelet
transform and a discussion of typical reconstruction errors and
execution times of this implementation.

<p>
It is considerably more accurate and efficient to perform our wavelet
transform on the sphere in harmonic space, hence this is the approach
adopted in the S2DW code.  The S2DW <i>library</i> itself considers only
the spherical harmonic representation of data defined on the sphere
and not real space representations.  Many different pixelisations
schemes for the sphere exist, with corresponding algorithms to perform
forward and inverse spherical harmonic transforms.  These algorithms
are not always exact, hence the core functionality of the S2DW code
operates on the spherical harmonic coefficients of signals only.
Users are then free to use any pixelisation of the sphere and the
computation of spherical harmonic coefficients is the users' concern.

<p>
A number of optional utility programs are also provided in the S2DW
code.  These enable users to perform the scale discretised wavelet
transform on data defined on the sphere in real space.  The <a
href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a> pixelisation of the
sphere is adopted for this purpose.  The spherical harmonic transform
on a HEALPix pixelisation is not exact, hence the reconstruction
accuracy of our S2DW code for real space data is limited by the
accuracy of the forward and inverse spherical harmonic transforms
provided by HEALPix.


<p>

file.




<HR>
<H2> Installation </H2>

<p>
The S2DW <i>library</i> requires only the <a
href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW</a> and <a
href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html">CFITSIO</a>
packages.  If one wishes to also use the utility programs then the <a
href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a> and <a
href="http://www.jasonmcewen.org/codes.html">S2</a> packages
are also required.  Please note that all S2DW code is written in
Fortran 90 and a suitable Fortran compiler will be required.


<H3> Compiling library </H3>

Before compiling you may need to edit the <a href="../makefile">makefile</a> to specify your
compiler and to link with the appropriate libraries.  Once you have
set the makefile up for your system then the S2DW library may be
compilied by running:
<blockquote>   
<code> >> make lib</code>
</blockquote>

For details on how to use the S2DW library code see the documentation
<a href="#library">below<a>.

<H3> Testing </H3>

A test program is provided to test the installation of the S2DW
library.  To make this program simply run:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make test</code>
</blockquote>
The test may then be performed by running:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make runtest</code>
</blockquote>
If you see the message '<i>Tests passed!</i>' printed then the S2DW
library has been installed correctly and is reconstructing the
spherical harmonic coefficients of a random test signal exactly from its
wavelet and scaling coefficients.  By default the test is performed at
a band limit of B=64.  To run the test for other band limits run:
<blockquote> <code>>> ./bin/s2dw_test xx</code> </blockquote> 
where xx is the band limit of the test.

<H3> Compiling utility programs </H3>
<p>
The utility programs require the <a
href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a> and <a
href="http://www.jasonmcewen.org/codes.html">S2</a> packages
to handle real space representations of data on the sphere (these are
not required for the S2DW library).  Before attempting to compile the
utility programs please ensure that these libraries are
linked correctly in the <a href="../makefile">makefile</a>.  Once these
libraries are linked you may compile the S2DW utility
programs by running:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make prog</code>
</blockquote>

For details on how to use the S2DW utility programs see the documentation
<a href="#utility">below<a>.

<H3> Documentation </H3>
<p>
By default, the S2DW code ships with only this single documentation
page.  The remainder of the documentation is automatically generated
from the source code using 
<a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~edemaine/f90doc/">f90doc</a>.  
Please ensure that you have f90doc installed in order to generate this
documentation.  Once f90doc is installed the documentation may be 
generated by running:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make docs</code>
</blockquote>

<H3> Cleaning up </H3>

To clean up your version of the S2DW code and return all code to its
original state run:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make clean</code>
</blockquote>

To remove all documentation, except the front page (i.e. this file),
run:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make cleandocs</code>
</blockquote>

<a name="library"><H2> Library documentation </H2></a>

The S2DW library contains all functionality to compute the scale
discretised wavelet transform on the sphere from the spherical
harmonic coefficients of a signal.  Real space representations of
signals on the sphere are not considered.  An overview of the modules
that comprise the S2DW library is given here.  Please click on the link
for each module for detailed documentation.

<HR>
<a name="utility"><H2> Utility program documentation </H2> </a>

The S2DW utility programs provide functionality for dealing with data
on the sphere in real space, where the <a
href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a> pixelisation of the
sphere is adopted.  Once spherical harmonic coefficients are computed,
the utility programs make use to the S2DW library to perform the scale
discretised wavelet transform on the sphere.  Please click on the link
for each program for detailed documentation.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_analysis.html>s2dw_analysis</a></CODE>: 
Computes the S2DW wavelet and scaling coefficients of a Healpix sky map.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_synthesis.html>s2dw_synthesis</a></CODE>: 
Reconstructs a Healpix sky map from S2DW wavelet and scaling coefficients.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_test.html>s2dw_test</a></CODE>:
Performs S2DW transform analysis and synthesis and check that the
original signal is reconstructed exactly (to numerical precision).
Note that this utility program does not deal with real space
representations of data on the sphere and hence does not require the
<a href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a> or <a
href="http://www.jasonmcewen.org/codes.html">S2</a> packages.

<HR>
<H2> MATLAB usage </H2>

The data associated with a scale discretised wavelet tranform of a
signal (including wavelet and scaling coefficients and other
parameters) may be written to either a FITS or Matlab m file.  The
binary FITS files are considerably smaller and faster to read/write.
However, for users who wish to analyse wavelet coefficients in
Matlab it is also possible to write matlab readable m files.  Utility
routines also exist to convert between these two file types.  A Matlab
routine to write the data back to an m file from within Matlab is
provided in the ./matlab subdirectory:

<P>
<CODE><a href=../matlab/s2dw_matlab_wav_write.m>s2dw_matlab_wav_write.m</a></CODE>: 
Write S2DW data manipulated in Matlab to a S2DW m file that can be read
by Matlab and the S2DW Fortran code.
